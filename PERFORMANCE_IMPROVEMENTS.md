## Technical Implementation Details

### New Classes and Components

#### ResourceManager
- Monitors system memory and CPU usage
- Tracks memory growth and peak usage
- Provides warnings when limits are exceeded
- Forces garbage collection when needed

#### SafeQueue
- Thread-safe queue with size limits
- Automatic item dropping when full
- Tracks dropped items for monitoring
- Prevents memory exhaustion from unlimited queues

#### LRUCache
- Least Recently Used cache implementation
- Size-limited to prevent memory leaks
- Thread-safe operations
- Automatic cleanup of old entries

### Performance Constants (Optimized)
```python
MAX_CONCURRENT_SCANS = max(1, min(2, multiprocessing.cpu_count() // 2))  # Conservative
BATCH_SIZE = 25                    # Reduced for better memory management
UI_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 100           # Slightly slower for stability
QUEUE_PROCESS_LIMIT = 5            # Reduced to prevent UI freezing
LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD = 50MB        # Reduced from 100MB
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100               # Prevent unlimited queue growth
MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 200               # Limit cache size
MEMORY_LIMIT_MB = 500              # Memory usage limit
FFMPEG_TIMEOUT = 300               # 5 minutes timeout
```

### Error Handling Improvements

## Performance Monitoring

### New Performance Dialog
- Real-time memory and CPU usage
- Cache size monitoring
- Queue status tracking
- Resource warnings display
- Manual garbage collection
- Cache clearing controls

### Logging System
- File-based logging (`video_converter.log`)
- Structured log messages with timestamps
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics logging

## Stability Improvements

### Crash Prevention
- **Signal Handlers**: Proper handling of system signals
- **Exception Handlers**: Global exception handling
- **Resource Cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup on exit
- **Thread Safety**: Thread-safe operations throughout

### Memory Leak Prevention
- **Bounded Collections**: All collections have size limits
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Periodic cleanup of unused resources
- **Reference Management**: Proper object reference management
- **Cache Limits**: All caches have maximum size limits

## User Experience Improvements

### Better Feedback
- **Progress Monitoring**: Detailed progress reporting
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status updates
- **Performance Stats**: Detailed performance information

### Reliability
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on application exit
