# Video Converter for iPhone - Python Dependencies
# 
# Note: This script primarily uses built-in Python libraries
# The main external dependency is FFmpeg (not a Python package)
#
# Built-in libraries used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - threading (for background processing)
# - subprocess (for running FFmpeg)
# - json (for parsing FFmpeg output)
# - pathlib (for file path handling)
# - queue (for thread communication)
# - datetime (for timestamps)

# Optional: If you want to add more advanced features later
# Pillow==10.1.0  # For image processing/thumbnails
# tqdm==4.66.1    # For progress bars in console mode
